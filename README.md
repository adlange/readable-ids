# readable-ids

The readable-ids library makes it possible to generate IDs that are easy for humans to read. It is based on dictionaries
that can either be created individually or selected from a supplied selection of different dictionaries. The library
offers various modifications and merging strategies that can be customized or created for specific applications. This
allows developers to create flexible and user-friendly IDs that are both easy to read and easy to remember.
